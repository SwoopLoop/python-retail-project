# python-retail-project


# ðŸ§­ Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data between 2016 and 2019 to uncover insights that can drive data-informed decisions for product performance and store efficiency.

The analysis follows a structured workflow, beginning with data extraction and cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), manipulation, and visualization. All data processing and transformations were conducted using Python, primarily leveraging libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## ðŸ§± Objectives

Data Extraction & Cleaning: Load the dataset and apply preliminary cleaning steps, such as handling missing values and formatting date/time columns.

Data Analysis: Identify the top-selling item per ZIP code and compute each store's share of total sales between 2016 and 2019.

Data Visualization: Display the findings through clear, informative visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, ensuring that results are both aesthetic and actionable.

Reporting: Summarize methods, analysis steps, and conclusions in a concise report alongside the supporting code and visual output.

## ðŸ§ª Scope & Constraints

All computations are performed via Python scripts â€” no manual manipulation of data.

The final output includes:

A Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.

Clean and focused visualizations designed to communicate the most important insights effectively.
